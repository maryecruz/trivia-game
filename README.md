Trivia Game is a series of 10 questions that have four multiple choice answers, a timer that counts down from 10 seconds and if the correct answer is not clicked the question automatically changes to the next question and counts it wrong. At the end of the 10 questions there is a report that shows how many question were answer correctly. If there are mutiple players, the report also puts the players in order from the player who got the most correct answer to the player who got the least correct answers.
